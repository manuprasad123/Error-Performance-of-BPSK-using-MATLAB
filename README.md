Error Performance of BPSK
1. Generate a string of message bits.
2. Encode using BPSK with energy per bit Eb and represent it using points in a signal-space.
3. Simulate transmission of the BPSK modulated signal via an AWGN channel with variance N0/2.
4. Detect using an ML decoder and plot the probability of error as a function of SNR per bit Eb/N0.
